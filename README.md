# Portfolio
Hi there.\
My name is Matthias Widler and I am pleased to present my portfolio to showcase my skills as a data engineer.

### Web Crawling
#### [Crawling project with Scrapy Framework](./Data_Mining/real_estate_data)
- That was a project that I implemented at the University of Applied Sciences of the Grisons.
- The aim was to collect data on available rental apartments for scientific studies.

### Data Cleaning
#### [Bank Marketing Campaign Data](./Data_Cleaning/Bank_Marketing_Campaign_Data)
- This was just an exercise to train data cleaning methods.
